Date: 22/3/2020

Next meeting: Wednesday 25/3/2020

Things to do before next meeting:
  1. Select a downstream task you'd like to work on -- toxicology/hate speech
  2. Search for datasets we can use (at least 2 or 3)
  3. Discuss embedding algorithms with Rebecca and Ricardo -- Tuesday @ 11
  4. Start writing the project proposal

Questions for the next meeting:
  1. Where does one find datasets from? Do we use tweets and reddit sort of data? This would be based on the downstream task.
  2. 
  
Meeting notes
-Wikipedia dataset for embeddings
-FastText word embedding algorithm
-downstream task - hate speech (M, Ri, Re), coreference resolution (S)
-languages English (M), Spanish (Ri), Russian (Re)
  some tasks have layers you can just use for pretrained embeddings
  hate speech - from scratch
  coreference resolution - no extra training data needed

                                        STARTING OUR PROJECT FULL-TIME!! 
                                        Meetings every Wednesday @ 2 p.m.
============================================================================================================================

Date: 20/5/2020
Discussed:
1. Get baseline system running
   - datasets: Similar type of data in downstream evaluation set and word embedding bias evaluation set. 
               Evaluation dataset is our most important datasetas it will be our main contraint.
               Check for bias focused hate speech dataset
   - embedding toolkit: Ideally should support GloVe and FastText.
               Check Gensim and Facebook's code for FastText.
               FastText is good for Twitter data due to misspelled words and short forms and such.
   - downstream toolkit: find toolkit for hate speech detection.
   
Questions:
1. Confusion about traning data. Do we need training data for the downstream task as well or do we simply split the data we
   will use for evaluation?
   
To do:
1. Find all datasets
2. Set up GPU access 
3. Understand Gensim - do a tutorial


Date: 27/5/2020
Discussed:
1. Training data for downstream task: There should be a training set for the evaluation set we are using.
            More granular data is preferred but only if enough data is available.
2. Using models for downstream task: If we can't find a suitable toolkit we can use a model from a reliable paper.
            Toolkits are preferred because they usually have better coding standards.
            
Questions:
1.

To do:
1. Finalise datasets
2. Think about what to do for GloVe
3. Train word embeddings
4. Discuss GPU access with R&R - MLP configuration does not work with Gensim.
