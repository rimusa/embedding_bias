Date: 22/3/2020

Next meeting: Wednesday 25/3/2020

Things to do before next meeting:
  1. Select a downstream task you'd like to work on -- toxicology/hate speech
  2. Search for datasets we can use (at least 2 or 3)
  3. Discuss embedding algorithms with Rebecca and Ricardo -- Tuesday @ 11
  4. Start writing the project proposal

Questions for the next meeting:
  1. Where does one find datasets from? Do we use tweets and reddit sort of data? This would be based on the downstream task.
  2. 
  
Meeting notes
-Wikipedia dataset for embeddings
-FastText word embedding algorithm
-downstream task - hate speech (M, Ri, Re), coreference resolution (S)
-languages English (M), Spanish (Ri), Russian (Re)
  some tasks have layers you can just use for pretrained embeddings
  hate speech - from scratch
  coreference resolution - no extra training data needed
